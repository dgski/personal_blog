I call it ‘thinking weather’; but it is a lot more than that.</p><p>Ouside, the rain strips away the meanderers, frollikers and just-having-fun-ers. Which are of course by no means negative elements of the city. But leaving behind only the ‘people with a reason to be out’, provides a type of locale clarity. People with un-skippable social events. Businesswomen on the way to important meetings. Tourists which desparately want to stick to their itineray. As I pass them on the sidewalks, I can’t help but feel a sense of elemental exposure camaraderie even as an joy-walking imposter.</p><p>Inside, the raindrops gathering on the windows absolve me of the guilt of not being ‘out’, a semi-permanent emotion metropolis residents have to deal with. “Why didn’t you check out that new art gallery?”; “It was raining!”. The weather outside makes me feel smaller, less significant, yet due to the paradox of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy">Hygge</a>, I feel more empowered and more important indoors. The outside world needs to be less inviting; to make the home more inviting.</p><p>Every city is really three cities; a day city, a night city and a rain city. I am thankful anytime I get to experience a new city in the rain because that travel is much harder to plan. And <em>a city at night and in the rain</em>, well… let’s just say if I was writing about that the post wouldn’t end.</p></div><div id="author-bio"></div></div></main><footer></footer><script async src="https://blog.davidgorski.ca/assets/js/scripts.js?v=3733efd39cd6c799b95c8fcb96993840"></script></body></html>
