But for an idea of mine to the surface and become 'real', it must complete a mental obstacle course equivalent to a medieval gauntlet.</p>\n<p>After a lot of thinking (ironically) I have decided go act more. One such act is the creation of this blog and first blog post.</p>\n<p>I am starting with stream-of-consiouness, low-effort writing. As I get more comfortable I hope to unload more serious and more fun topics. Signing off for the first time. DG.</p>",
